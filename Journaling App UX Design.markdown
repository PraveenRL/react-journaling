  - Secondary: Neutral gray (#4A4A4A) for text and borders.
  - Background: White (#FFFFFF) or Dark (#1C2526) based on theme.
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Sans-serif, bold (e.g., Roboto, 18-24px).
  - Body: Sans-serif, regular (e.g., Roboto, 14-16px).
- **Spacing**:
  - Consistent padding/margins (16px for major elements, 8px for minor).
  - Card-based layout with subtle shadows for depth.
- **Icons**:
  - Use a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Icons) for actions like edit, delete, and search.

## Accessibility Considerations
- Keyboard navigation support for all actions.
- High-contrast mode for text and buttons.
- ARIA labels for interactive elements (e.g., buttons, inputs).
- Responsive font sizes for readability on small screens.

## Technical Notes for React Development
- **Component Structure**:
  - Reusable components: `EntryCard`, `RichTextEditor`, `CalendarGrid`, `TagChip`.
  - Layout components: `Header`, `Sidebar`, `BottomNav`.
- **State Management**:
  - Use React Context or Redux for managing entries, tags, and settings.
  - Local storage or backend API for persisting entries.
- **Routing**:
  - Use React Router for navigating between Home, Calendar, Tags, and Settings.
- **Styling**:
  - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
  - Support light/dark themes via CSS variables or Tailwindâ€™s dark mode.
- **Rich Text Editor**:
  - Consider libraries like `react-quill` or `draft-js` for rich text functionality.
- **Data Structure** (suggested):
  ```json
  {
    "entries": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "title": "string",
        "content": "string",
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
        "tags": ["string"],
        "createdAt": "timestamp",
        "updatedAt": "timestamp"
      }
    ],
    "tags": ["string"]
  }
  ```

## Additional Features (Optional for Future Development)
- Mood tracking: Add a mood selector (e.g., emoji-based) for each entry.
- Reminders: Set daily/weekly writing reminders.
- Statistics: Display writing streaks or word count trends.
- Cloud sync: Support for syncing entries across devices (requires backend).
